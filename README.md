## Other cheatsheets

### Mine

- [ghing/python-data-cheatsheet](https://github.com/ghing/python-data-cheatsheet): : Things in Python, Pandas, GeoPandas and Jupyter that I've had to look up or weren't obvious in the documentation.
- [ghing/r-data-cheatsheet](https://github.com/ghing/r-data-cheatsheet): Notebooks that describe tasks that I use when working with data for journalism in R but don't do often enough to remember off the top of my head.
