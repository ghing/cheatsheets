# Sway

The key-bindings are very customizable and defined in the config file in `~/.config/sway/config`, so I won't duplicate that here. Instead, these are commands needed to do certain things that aren't immediately accessible in the UI.

## Bluetooth

Use `bluetoothctl` or `blueman-manager`.

## WiFi 

Use `nmtui`.
